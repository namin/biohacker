\section{Conclusion}

By representing our domain knowledge declaratively, the underlying
Truth Maintenance System can effectively reason about the behavior of
the metabolic network.  Furthermore, as additional knowledge about how
to debug metabolic networks is gained, we expect that only small
changes in the code will be necessary to accommodate those changes.
We plan to continue developing this system with the eventual goal of
releasing the software to the Pathway-tools community to aid in the
rapid reconstruction of metabolic networks.
