\section{Network Debugger}
\subsection{Overview}
The user of the network debugger provides a model of the network and a
set of experiments. For each experiment, the network debugger assesses
whether the experiment is consistent with the model, explaining why
(with a queryable proof) or why not (with queryable minimal fixes).
