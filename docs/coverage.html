<h2>Given</h2>

<h3>Beliefs holding over all organisms</h3>

<p>
We believe in a set of chemical <em>reactions</em>, converting
<em>reactants</em> (inputs) into <em>products</em> (outputs).  These
reactions are organized into <em>pathways</em>, typically catabolisms,
converting nutrients into intermediary compounds, and anabolisms,
converting intermediary compounds into essential compounds. The notion
of <em>converter</em> from a set of inputs to a set of outputs
generalizes over reactions and pathways. A converter is either
primitive (a reaction) or compound (a pathway). A compound converter
is a graph, where each node represents a converter; each directed edge,
an inner input-output dependency; each dangling incoming edge, an input;
and each dangling outgoing edge, an output. With these primitives
(reactions), means of combinations (pathways) and means of
abstractions (converters), we organize our set of reactions
hierarchically.
</p>

<h3>Assumptions per organism</h3>

<p>
We assume an organism is capable of <em>catalyzing</em> a subset of
our universal set of reactions, because an organism has genes, and genes codes for proteins, and proteins forms enzymes, and
enzymes control reactions.
</p>

<h3>Beliefs holding per organism</h3>

<p>
For each organism, we believe in a set of compounds essential for
growth of the organism.  Crucially, we collect and also believe some growth
/ no-growth <em>experiments</em>.  In addition to an <em>outcome</em>
(growth / no-growth), an experiment specifies the presence/absence of
nutrients and genes.
</p>


<h2>Show</h2>

<h3>Underestimations / Completeness</h3>

<p>
If we enable the assumptions of a <em>growth experiment</em>, and we
<em>cannot</em> produce all essential compounds, we have a contradiction: our
assumptions of the organisms must contain <em>false negatives</em>,
i.e. some <em>additional</em> universal converters should be assumed.
</p>

<h3>Overestimations / Coherence</h3>

<p>
If we enable the assumptions of a <em>no-growth experiment</em>, and
we <em>can</em> produce all essential compounds, we have a contradiction: our
asssumptions of the organisms must contain <em>false positives</em>,
i.e. some assumptions must be <em>retracted</em>.
</p>

<h2>Efficienctly</h2>

<p>
By organizing the converters hierarchically, we can consider the
higher-level converters first, delving into their internals only when
necessary or requested.
