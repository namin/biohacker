    "> I am building a reflective relational program synthesizer. It uses as its underlying solver a relational program synthesizer, and it augments it with higher level strategies such as templating recursive functions based on inferred types of arguments. What more could I do? How to make it reflexive?\n",
    "\n",
    "1 / 1\n",
    "\n",
    "It sounds like you're off to a great start with your reflective relational program synthesizer. To make it more reflexive, consider the following enhancements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Meta-strategies: Implement meta-strategies that allow the synthesizer to reason about its own strategies and adapt them based on the problem at hand. This could involve dynamically selecting, composing, or even generating new strategies based on prior performance or feedback.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.  Self-optimization: Enable the synthesizer to optimize its own parameters and internal representations during synthesis. This may involve fine-tuning algorithmic choices, adjusting the weight of different strategies, or learning from previous synthesis attempts.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3.  Active learning: Integrate active learning techniques to enable the synthesizer to actively query and update its knowledge based on the problem context. This can be achieved through interactions with users or external sources of information.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4.  Learning from user feedback: Incorporate mechanisms to accept and learn from user feedback, such as corrections or suggestions. This will help the synthesizer to improve over time and adapt to the user's preferences and problem domains.\n",
    "    \n",
    "5.  Analogical reasoning: Enhance the synthesizer's ability to reason by analogy, allowing it to draw on similarities between the current problem and previously encountered problems. This can help it to identify and apply appropriate templates, patterns, or strategies more effectively.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6.  Explanation generation: Equip the synthesizer with the ability to generate human-readable explanations for its synthesized programs. This can increase user trust and provide insights into the synthesizer's reasoning process.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7.  Adaptive granularity: Design the synthesizer to adjust the level of granularity at which it synthesizes programs, depending on the problem's complexity and available resources. This may involve generating higher-level abstractions or decomposing a problem into smaller subproblems.\n",
    "    \n",
    "8.  Incremental synthesis: Develop an incremental synthesis approach that allows the synthesizer to generate partial solutions and iteratively refine them based on feedback or new information. This can help the synthesizer to cope with larger and more complex problems.\n",
    "    \n",
    "9.  Collaboration with other solvers: Enable the synthesizer to collaborate with other solvers, synthesizers, or AI systems to tackle complex problems more effectively. This could involve dividing the problem into subproblems and delegating them to specialized systems or using their expertise to guide its own reasoning process.\n",
    "    \n",
    "10.  Continuous learning: Implement continuous learning mechanisms that allow the synthesizer to update and improve its knowledge base, strategies, and internal representations over time. This can help it to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements and problem domains in its target areas.\n",
    "    \n",

    "By incorporating some or all of these enhancements, you can make your reflective relational program synthesizer more reflexive and adaptive, increasing its ability to effectively tackle a wide range of problems.\n",
