#|
A problem is specified by an initial state, a set of operators that
act on states to produce new states, and a means of recognizing when
the goal has been achieved.  In this implementation the PROBLEM struct
holds this information.  To provide maximum flexiblity, we assume
nothing about states, but define the problem space in terms of a set
of procedures.
