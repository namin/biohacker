#|
A problem consists of an equation in the unknown, X.  The goal is
to construct an equation that has just X on the left hand side,
and no occurences of X on the RHS.

A state in these problems has the form (= <lhs> <rhs>).  The
sides are just s-expressions corresponding to mathematical terms.
We provide a basic simplification program in another file to take
care of mundane stuff like collapsing constants.

This file contains the operator descriptions and CPS hooks.  The
function SETUP-ALGEBRA-PROBLEM sets up the algebra problem space.
