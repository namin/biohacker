To run the model, the following forms will be helpful.

Place the following form in biohacker/trunk/ptools/data/*-experiments.lisp 

(experiment <name>  <nutrient-list>
 	    :growth? <T or nil>
	    :knock-outs <list of genes asserted to be off>
	    :knock-ins  <list of genes asserted to be on>
	    :toxins     <list of compounds that if produced cause no-growth experimental outcomes>
	    :bootstrap-compounds   <list of compounds that are asserted to exist, but not nutrients>
	    :essential-compounds <list of compounds that must be produced in order to achieve growth>)

Place the following forms in biohacker/trunk/ptools/data/*-network.lisp

(reaction <name>
	  :reactants <list of reactants>
