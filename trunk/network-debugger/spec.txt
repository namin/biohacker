To run the model, the following forms will be helpful.

Place the following form in biohacker/trunk/ptools/data/*-experiments.lisp 

(experiment <name>  <nutrient-list>
 	    :growth? <T or nil>
	    :knock-outs <list of genes asserted to be off>
	    :knock-ins  <list of genes asserted to be on>
	    :toxins     <list of compounds that if produced cause no-growth experimental outcomes (disjunctive)>
	    :bootstrap-compounds   <list of compounds that are asserted to exist, but not nutrients>
	    :essential-compounds <list of compounds that must be produced in order to achieve growth (conjunctive)>)

Place the following forms in biohacker/trunk/ptools/data/*-network.lisp

(reaction/pathway <name>
	  :reactants <list of reactants>
	  :products <list of products>
	  :reversible? <t / nil / :UNKNOWN > ; by default, :UNKNOWN for reactions and nil for pathways
	  :enzymes  <list of enzymes
                     (disjunctive for reactions, unspecified logic for pathways)
                    - nil for a reaction means that NO enzymes catalyze it
                      i.e. the reaction will never be fired 
                           but might play a role in abduction
                    - :SPONTANEOUS, instead of a list, means that no enzymes are needed
                    - (:UNKNOWN) means that some unknown enzyme is needed
                      :UNKNOWN can be part of any enzyme list & will be treated specially
                    >
          pathway-only keys
	  :reactions <list of all reactions in the pathway>
	  :proper-products <list of the actual end products of a pathway (should be a subset of products, products by default)>
	  )

(enzyme <name> . <list of genes (conjunctive)>)
The list of genes may contain :UNKNOWN, meaning that the enzyme has
some unknown gene contributing to its formation.
