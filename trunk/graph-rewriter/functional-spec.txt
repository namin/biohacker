matcher

two problems. brandx. nutrient cultivation. 

data representation questions. 
     -- data:  alcohol, aldehyde: adjacency list, InChi, ...
     -- rules: alcohol dehydrogenase: graph rewriting

steps:
     to apply a rule, need:
     -- recognize graph substructure: pattern matcher
     -- transformation: graph rewriting, substitute/replace

matcher used to query a database. 
matcher used as a prelude to substitution.

hairiness

* subgraph isomorphism: NP complete
  -- nodes are typed (by atom)
  -- edges are typed (by bond)

* combinatorial explosion of possible adjacency graphs. 
  
* complex semantics: database represents hydrogen optionally
   -- solvable by cononicalization
   -- solvable semantic pattern matching

To solve the Xenobiotic metabolism problem, we use a rule-based
system, where we match a substructure pattern against a list of
possible substrates.  When we find a match, then we instantiate a
template transformation.

* Gamma_s = substrate atom-bond graph:  A adjacency list where atoms are indexed typed nodes and bonds are typed edges. 
* \delta^- = substrate pattern: A rule trigger pattern 
* \delta^+ = product template:  What we use to replace the pattern that we matched.
* Gamma_p = product atom-bond graph. A representation of product chemical structure as an adjacency list where atoms are indexed types and bonds are typed edges

* substrate match bindings:  A set of mappings from substrate pattern to the substrate atom-bond graph represented as an array of atom correspondences.
* biotransformation bindings: A set of mappings from substrate pattern to product template
* product instantiation: A set of mappings from biotransformation bindings and substrate match bindings to product atom-bond graph
